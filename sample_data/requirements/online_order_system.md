# Product Requirements Document: Chicken Vendor Order Capturing System (CVOCS)

## 1. Objective
Develop a digital order capturing system for a chicken-selling vendor to streamline in-person and online orders, reduce manual errors, and improve customer satisfaction.

## 2. Background
The vendor currently uses paper-based order tracking, leading to inefficiencies. The new system will digitize order management, inventory tracking, and customer interactions.

## 3. User Roles
- **Customers**: Place orders (in-person/online), view history, redeem loyalty points.
- **Vendors**: Manage orders, update inventory, generate reports.
- **Admins**: Configure system settings, manage user access, oversee audits.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Order Management
- Place orders via in-person (kiosk/staff device) or online portal.
- Modify/cancel orders within 15 minutes of placement.
- View order history with search/filter by date, status, or customer.

### 4.2 Inventory Management
- Real-time stock tracking (e.g., whole chickens, cuts, marinated products).
- Low-stock alerts (<10% threshold) and automated supplier notifications.
- Track supplier lead times and update inventory on restock.

### 4.3 Payment Processing
- Accept cash, credit/debit cards, and mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay).
- Integrate with PCI-compliant payment gateways (Stripe, Square).
- Email/SMS receipts with order summary.

### 4.4 Customer Management
- Customer profiles (contact info, preferences, order history).
- Loyalty program: Earn 1 point per $1 spent, redeemable for discounts.
- SMS/email notifications for order confirmation and readiness.

### 4.5 Reporting & Analytics
- Daily/weekly sales reports (total revenue, popular items).
- Inventory turnover rates and stockout frequency.
- Customer segmentation by purchase behavior.

### 4.6 System Administration
- Role-based access (e.g., vendor staff vs. admins).
- Configure loyalty rules, tax rates, and notification templates.
- Audit logs for order changes and user activity.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Support 100 concurrent users, <2s response time.
- **Security**: Encrypt customer data (AES-256), PCI-DSS compliance.
- **Usability**: Intuitive UI with <30-minute staff training.
- **Compatibility**: Web (Chrome, Safari) and mobile (iOS 14+, Android 10+).
- **Scalability**: Scale to 500 concurrent users within 12 months.

## 6. Assumptions & Dependencies
- **Assumptions**: Stable internet, staff training post-deployment.
- **Dependencies**: Stripe API, Twilio SMS, cloud hosting (AWS/Azure).

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
| **Risk**                           | **Mitigation**                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Payment gateway integration delays | Allocate 3-week buffer for API testing          |
| Staff resistance to new system     | Gamified training + performance incentives      |
