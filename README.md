# Project Overview
----

This project is a comprehensive system designed to streamline the process of managing software development projects. It leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automate tasks, improve collaboration, and enhance overall project efficiency.

## Features
--------

*   **Automated Task Generation**: The system uses NLP to analyze project requirements and generate tasks for team members.
*   **Confluence Page Search**: The system can search for Confluence pages containing specific phrases to gather information about projects.
*   **Jira Integration**: The system integrates with Jira to retrieve project information, including epics, stories, and tickets.
*   **Stakeholder Management**: The system can identify stakeholders and their roles in the project.
*   **Requirements Gap Analysis**: The system performs gap analysis on project requirements to identify potential issues.

## Tools and Technologies
------------------------

*   **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
*   **Ollama**: A machine learning model used for natural language processing tasks.
*   **Jira**: A project management tool used for issue tracking and project planning.
*   **Confluence**: A collaboration tool used for documentation and knowledge sharing.
*   **Atlassian**: A suite of tools used for project management, collaboration, and development.

## System Components
-------------------

*   **Agent**: The core component of the system, responsible for automating tasks and integrating with other tools.
*   **Agent Toolbox**: A collection of tools and utilities used by the agent to perform tasks.
*   **Jira Project**: A component responsible for interacting with Jira to retrieve project information.
*   **Confluence Page Search**: A component responsible for searching Confluence pages for specific phrases.

## Usage
-----

1.  Install the required dependencies, including Python, Ollama, and Atlassian tools.
2.  Configure the system by setting environment variables for Jira, Confluence, and other tools.
3.  Run the agent using the provided configuration file.
4.  Interact with the system using natural language inputs to generate tasks, retrieve project information, and perform other actions.
