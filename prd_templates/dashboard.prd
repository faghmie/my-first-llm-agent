# Business assessment. 
A business assessment aims to help you understand the business’ goals and how well its equipped to reach them. The best way to conduct such an assessment is to look at the company’s KPIs. These’ll help you learn about a business’s health, past performance, and future potential.

# Data Assessment. 
Next comes a preview of the available data and its integrity. Some things to look at include finding out how accurate the data is, how complex it is, whether it’s relevant to the goals a business aims to achieve, and how fresh it is.

# User Group Assessment. 
This involves profiling the people involved in the dashboard creation process. Considering lots of people are involved in the process — from stakeholders who consume it to data providers, it’s important you understand each group’s requirements and usage patterns.

# Security Assessment. 
Since a handful of people are involved in this process, it’s essential you take security into account too — that’s what this last assessment is about. Find answers to questions like how users will be authenticated to access the dashboard, what security check-ins will be in place, and so on.
